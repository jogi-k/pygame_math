# pygame math

Just a repo to keep some (ugly) python scripts to show my kids some math functionality with the help of python / pygame / pygame zero

## Precondition 

You need to have pygame and pgzero installed: 

```pip install pygame```   
```pip install pgzero```

Starting then with:

```pgzrun <programm.py>```


## trigonometry.py

```pgzrun trigonometry.py```


Shows a Circle, with a line of an angle of 30Â° and sin and cos - lines for that.   
The values are printed (in german) on the upper left corner.   

Control with keyboard:
* left : angle - 1
* right : angle + 1
* page_up : angle + 10
* page_down :  angle - 10
* W : angle = 90
* A : angle = 180
* S : angle = 270
* D : angle = 0
